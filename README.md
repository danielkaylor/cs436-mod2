2 Consoles (A & B). 
Each has an ESP32, a joystick, toggle switch and push button.
Each is preprogrammed to send "B T X Y " over Serial at baudrate 115200 every 50ms.
The program can be found in the test.ino file.

For the graphics, we rely on Processing. Taking in input from 2 (or more) consoles, the user can control its player in the arena.
